# Mario Weil

## Hi!

Welcome to my profile.  
Let me introduce myself: I currently work for KM.ON in Frankfurt.    
I'm employed as ~~a Project Manager~~ the Enablement Center Lead.  

All my professional dedication and passion goes to our product.  
It is a digital ecosystem for the Karl Mayer, a textile machinery manufacturer and it serves. 
as the basis for all the Industry 4.0 services that enable the SMART TEXTILE MACHINE.   

I mostly work from home for more than 2 years now and what I heavily miss is the personal contact  
with my colleagues and the information exchange, e.g. in the coffee corner 
(which very often leads to new insights, additional ideas etc.)
