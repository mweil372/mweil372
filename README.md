# Mario Weil

## Hi!

Welcome to my profile.  
Let me introduce myself: I currently work for KM.ON in Frankfurt.  
I'm employed as a Project Manager.  

All my professional dedication and passion go to our product,
which is a price-winning Inflight-Entertainment System. 
You can use it onboard several airlines' aircraft. (and maybe you already have used it)

I mostly work from home for around 2 years now and what I heavily miss is the personal contact
with my colleagues and the information exchange, e.g. in the coffee corner 
(which very often leads to new insights, additional ideas etc.)
